/**
 * The graphical user interface for the shortest paths algorithm (you don't need
 * to look at or understand this package, but you can run it to play with the gui).
 * 
 * Running the Main class well let you test your shortest paths algorithm on
 * a randomly generated graph.  If you would prefer to load a specific graph
 * from a file, you can edit the run configuration in eclipse (the little arrow
 * next to the run button) and add the filename to the "arguments" box.
